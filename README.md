This is my take on brainfuck. It isn't anything special, it's just a general improvement to make it from a jokey challange language to an actually useful challange language. The added features are thus:
-"If pointed cell nonzero" statements
-File I/O
-Generic I/O (as in, ability to input numbers as numbers and not as ASCII characters)
-Error messages in case you fuck up
